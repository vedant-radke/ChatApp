-----------------------------------
Migration:
A migration is updating your database schema to match changes in your schema.prisma.
Think of it as “moving your database from old structure → new structure.”
Keeps your DB in sync with your Prisma models.

Command:
npx prisma migrate dev --name=descriptive_name

Meaning:
npx prisma migrate dev → apply migration in development.
--name=descriptive_name → gives the migration a human-readable label.

Keep in mind:
Run this every time you change the schema (new model, column, relation).
